# Node Energy Card (Deprecated)

This repository is deprecated.

Use the Home Assistant integration repository with ApexCharts instead:

## Migration
1. Keep `Node Energy` integration installed from HACS.
2. Install `ApexCharts Card` from HACS Frontend.
3. Replace `custom:node-energy-card` with the ApexCharts YAML example in:
